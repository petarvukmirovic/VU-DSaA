# VU-DSaA
Data Structures and Algorithms exercise framework

Dear students, you can find the simple implementations of Singly linked lists, Binary Search Trees and AVL trees here.

You can use them as a starting point for implementing solutions to exercises for which you are not 
sure if you can implement them correctly in a real programming language.

As always, should you have any questions, you are completely free to contact me on p.vukmirovic@vu.nl 
(or p2.vukmirovic@student.vu.nl which is an alias for this e-mail).

Have fun,
Petar Vukmirovic.
